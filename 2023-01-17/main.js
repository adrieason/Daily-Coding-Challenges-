/*Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]*/

/*
Fun with lists: lastIndexOf
Implement the method lastIndexOf (last_index_of in PHP and Python), which accepts a linked list (head) and a value, and returns the index (zero based) of the last occurrence of that value if exists, or -1 otherwise.

For example: Given the list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3, and the value 3, lastIndexOf / last_index_of should return 3.

The linked list is defined as follows:

function Node(data, next = null) {
  this.data = data;
  this.next = next;
}
Note: the list may be null/None and can hold any type of value.

Good luck!*/

    if (value === head.data) found = i; //if value === head.data, change found to the loop count number
    I++; //add one to the head counter
    head = head.next; //go to the next value in the head. 
  }
  return found;

/*Implement the method length, which accepts a linked list (head), and returns the length of the list.

For example: Given the list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4, length should return 4.

  /*There are n seats and n students in a room. You are given an array seats of length n, where seats[i] is the position of the ith seat. You are also given the array students of length n, where students[j] is the position of the jth student.

You may perform the following move any number of times:

Increase or decrease the position of the ith student by 1 (i.e., moving the ith student from position x to x + 1 or x - 1)
Return the minimum number of moves required to move each student to a seat such that no two students are in the same seat.

Note that there may be multiple seats or students in the same position at the beginning.

 

Example 1:

Input: seats = [3,1,5], students = [2,7,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: The students are moved as follows:
- The first student is moved from from position 2 to position 1 using 1 move.
- The second student is moved from from position 7 to position 5 using 2 moves.
- The third student is moved from from position 4 to position 3 using 1 move.
In total, 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 moves were used.
Example 2:

Input: seats = [4,1,5,9], students = [1,3,2,6]
Output: 7
Explanation: The students are moved as follows:
- The first student is not moved.
- The second student is moved from from position 3 to position 4 using 1 move.
- The third student is moved from from position 2 to position 5 using 3 moves.
- The fourth student is moved from from position 6 to position 9 using 3 moves.
In total, 0 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 7 moves were used.
Example 3:

Input: seats = [2,2,6,6], students = [1,3,2,6]
Output: 4
Explanation: Note that there are two seats at position 2 and two seats at position 6.
The students are moved as follows:
- The first student is moved from from position 1 to position 2 using 1 move.
- The second student is moved from from position 3 to position 6 using 3 moves.
- The third student is not moved.
- The fourth student is not moved.
In total, 1 + 3 + 0 + 0 = 4 moves were used.
