# Daily-Coding-Challenges- <br> [CodeWars Link](https://www.codewars.com/users/adrieason) <br>[LeetCode Link](https://leetcode.com/adrianname/)<br>

A repository that includes all of my Daily Coding Challenges. I solve a coding challenge everyday on Codewars or Leetcode! My main language is JavaScript. 

## Optimizations
I refractor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability. I focus on the analysis of the coding challenge. 

## Lessons Learned:
I am a life-long learner. The more challenges I do the better I get at it. I love being challenged each and every day. These are a great way to warm up prior to working on projects.
