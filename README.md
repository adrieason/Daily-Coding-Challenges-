A repository that included all of my Daily Coding Challenges.  I do at least one coding challenge a day. 

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript
I solve a coding challenge everyday on Codewars!

## Optimizations
I refractor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability.

## Lessons Learned:
I am a life-long learner. The more challenges I do the better I get at it. I love being challenged each and every day.
