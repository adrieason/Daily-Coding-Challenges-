# Daily-Coding-Challenges- Challenges: [CodeWars Link](https://www.codewars.com/users/adrieason) [LeetCode Link] (https://leetcode.com/adrianname/)

A repository that includes all of my Daily Coding Challenges.  I do at least one coding challenge a day.  

**Tech used:** JavaScript
I solve a coding challenge everyday on Codewars or Leetcode!

## Optimizations
I refractor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability. I focus on the analysis of the coding challenge. 

## Lessons Learned:
I am a life-long learner. The more challenges I do the better I get at it. I love being challenged each and every day. These are a great way to warm up prior to working on projects.
