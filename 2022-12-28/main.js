/*In this kata, your job is to return the two distinct highest values in a list. If there're less than 2 unique values, return as many of them, as possible.

The result should also be ordered from highest to lowest.

Examples:

[4, 10, 10, 9]  =>  [10, 9]
[1, 1, 1]  =>  [1]
[]  =>  []*/

/*Task:
Mr. despair wants to jump off Dutch act, So he came to the top of a building.

Input: floor, The height of the building (floor)

Output: a string, The voice of despair(When jumping Dutch act)

Mr. despair jumped from the 2 floor, the voice is "Aa~"
He fell on the ground, the voice is "Pa!"
He did not die immediately, and the final voice was "Aa!"
sc(6) should return "Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Pa! Aa!"

sc(7) should return "Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Pa!"

sc(10) should return "Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Pa!"

if floor<=1, Mr. despair is safe, return ""*/
