/*Basic Classes, this kata is mainly aimed at the new JS ES6 Update introducing classes

Task

Your task is to complete this Class, the Person class has been created. You must fill in the Constructor method to accept a name as string and an age as number, complete the get Info property and getInfo method/Info getter which should return johns age is 34*/

/*Something is wrong with our Warrior class. The strike method does not work correctly. The following shows an example of this code being used:

var ninja = new Warrior('Ninja');
var samurai = new Warrior('Samurai');

Can you figure out what is wrong?

  /*n a small town the population is p0 = 1000 at the beginning of a year. The population regularly increases by 2 percent per year and moreover 50 new inhabitants per year come to live in the town. How many years does the town need to see its population greater or equal to p = 1200 inhabitants?

At the end of the first year there will be: 
1000 + 1000 * 0.02 + 50 => 1070 inhabitants

At the end of the 2nd year there will be: 
1070 + 1070 * 0.02 + 50 => 1141 inhabitants (** number of inhabitants is an integer **)

At the end of the 3rd year there will be:
1141 + 1141 * 0.02 + 50 => 1213

It will need 3 entire years.
More generally given parameters:

p0, percent, aug (inhabitants coming or leaving each year), p (population to equal or surpass)

the function nb_year should return n number of entire years needed to get a population greater or equal to p.

aug is an integer, percent a positive or null floating number, p0 and p are positive integers (> 0)
